    "about_description": "<p>I am a 21 year old rap artist, producer and songwriter from Ireland. The main genre of my music is hip hop/rap. I've always had a passion for music, whether it would be listening or creating it on my own.</p><p>I began by producing simple beats to understand and learn the basics of music production. I then decided to start writing lyrics to express myself through a poetic style of rap.</p><p>Nobody knows what the future holds, so for now I will continue to vibe and make beats to rap over them.</p>",
